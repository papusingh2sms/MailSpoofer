5HR3D's Mail Spoofer. Spoof E-mails.
## What is it actually?
Email spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. The core email protocols do not have any mechanism for authentication, making it common for spam and phishing emails to use such spoofing to mislead or even prank the recipient about the origin of the message. via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing">WikiPedia</a>.

The folder "Site" contains MailSpoofer's web-application's files. Check for hosting services which support SMTP and host it there. I would simply suggest '000webhost'.
